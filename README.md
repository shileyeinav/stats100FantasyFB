Predicting NFL Wide Receiver Fantasy Performance in their Rookie Season

The all_data folder includes all the yearly data for players from their last year in college, combine, and rookie years in the NFL. 
The nfl_draft_wr_2000_2023.csv file is the draft pick data for every player since 2000.
The project.Rmd file is the R code file that reads in all the csv's and builds the data frame we use to build our model and test it as well.
